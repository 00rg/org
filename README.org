*** TODO Realistic example [0/1]
- [ ] Can we avoid making every app have an overlay for every cluster?
  - Try to use Components to avoid this
  - Would be good for apps just to need an overlay for each environment class (i.e., development, production, etc), rather than cluster (i.e., development-ap-southeast-2, etc) in general (some apps might need specific overlays and that's probably OK too)
